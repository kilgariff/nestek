# NESTEK

https://lowtekgames.itch.io/nestek

Originally developed for [Lowtek Games](http://lowtek.co.uk)' FLEA!, NESTEK makes it quick and easy to distribute your homebrew NES games on platforms such as Steam.

Forked from FCEUX (a very mature and accurate emulator), NESTEK loads a single ROM (game.nes) from the same directory as the NESTEK executable. It can also load a custom icon file (icon.ico) and a 256x224 splash image (splash.png).

It supports a developer-supplied config file with keymappings and allows the end user to change these mappings using NESTEK's built-in menu (press ESCAPE while the emulator is running to see it).

Instructions on how to write a NESTEK config file are in the works.

Development work was carried out by [Kilgariff Technologies](https://kilgariff.tech) and commissioned by [Lowtek Games](http://lowtek.co.uk) as a useful tool for the NES homebrew community.

We'd like to know if your game uses NESTEK! Let us know on the [itch.io page](https://lowtekgames.itch.io/nestek).
